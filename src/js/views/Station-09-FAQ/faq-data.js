        text: "A hackathon is any event of any duration where people come together to solve problems with digital means and present them to each other. That’s it, really simple. In most cases a hackathon is on two days and you get 24 hours time for the hacking. Hacking is meant in the sense of exploratory programming, not referenced to any computer crime."
